# voya-angularjs

Hello! This is project designed to be a starting point for creating an Angular 4 app.

This includes several tasks:

1. Port the app to Angular 4.

2. Use Webpack to load all of the files.

3. Create a navbar using Bootstrap or Angular Material (preferred, also if you can change everything to use it and remove Bootstrap, it's a bonus). You don't need to add other routes or pages.

4. Remove bower and use only npm.

5. In the home route, add a list which displays all of the former bower libraries. Check if their providers/services are present and change the list item some colour of your choice.

6. Add a route for the not-found controller, change it to AngularJs + JavaScript and use the UpgradeAdapter class.

Please do not remove the footer text. You can add more to it. :D
