# voya-angularjs

Hello! This is project designed to be a starting point for creating an Angular 4 app.

This includes several tasks:

1. Port the app to Angular 4.

2. Use Webpack to load all of the files.

3. (optional) Create a navbar using Bootstrap or Angular Material (preferred, also if you can change everything to use it and remove Bootstrap, it's a bonus). You don't need to add other routes or pages.

4. (optional) The "not-found" controller needs to be changed to AngularJS + JavaScript, have it's route configured and it should use upgradeAdapter.

Please do not remove the footer text. You can add more to it. :D
